A Windows Sidebar gadget designed to display a web page in a minimal 
window and avoid the overhead and wasted screen real estate with 
displaying the same web page in an internet browser window such as 
Internet Explorer.

This is a useful gadget to display a constantly updating web page in 
a small window without the overhead of a internet browser i.e. 
streaming music sites would be a good example for this gadget.

By developing a Sidebar gadget the features offered by gadgets can be 
implemented providing user interaction not typically associated with 
displaying the web page in an internet browser window, including 
window can be pinned to always be on top of other windows, 
have opacity when not actively viewed, being quickly expanded and 
shrunk, not being accidentally closed when exiting out of an internet 
browsing session, etc.
