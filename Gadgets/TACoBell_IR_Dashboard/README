NOTE: If you are not a Siemens PLM GTAC employee this gadget may not 
make much sense to you but this is still a great example of how to 
display any web page inside a Windows gadget instead of an internet
browser window.

A Windows Sidebar gadget designed to display the GTAC EMEA TACoBell 
IR Dashboard in a minimal window and avoid the overhead and wasted 
screen real estate with displaying the TACoBell IR Dashboard in an 
internet browser window such as Internet Explorer.

By developing a Sidebar gadget the features offered by gadgets can be 
implemented providing user interaction not typically associated with 
displaying the TACoBell IR Dashboard in an internet browser window, 
including window can be pinned to always be on top of other windows, 
have opacity when not actively viewed, being quickly expanded and 
shrunk, not being accidentally closed when exiting out of an internet 
browsing session, etc.
