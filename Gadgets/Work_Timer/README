A Windows Sidebar gadget for a simple pomodoro style countdown timer 
for Windows.

Features include:
    Autostart
    Single-click start/stop and double-click reset
    Selectable alarm sound and customisable alarm message
    Selectable font and background colours to match your desktop theme
    Customisable flashing paused alert
    Negative timer once alarm fired

The idea for this gadget came from my previous use of Dan Hersham's 
SnapTimer program (http://dan.hersam.com/software/snaptimer/).  The
alarm audio .wav files are copied from SnapTimer.

Colour picker code used in the options courtesy of Jan Odvárko at
